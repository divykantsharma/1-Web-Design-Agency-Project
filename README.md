# 1-Web-Design-Agency-Project
Created this project using HTML and external CSS.

-> Uses of a Web Design Agency Project :
1. Website Creation: HTML and CSS are the fundamental building blocks of websites. A web design agency project made with HTML and CSS allows you to create visually appealing and interactive websites.
2. Customization: With HTML and CSS, you have complete control over the design and layout of your website. You can create unique and tailored designs that align with your brand identity and client requirements.
3. Compatibility: HTML and CSS are supported by all modern web browsers, ensuring broad compatibility for your website across different platforms.
4. Flexibility: HTML and CSS provide great flexibility when it comes to designing websites. You have full control over the structure, layout, and styling of each element on the page.
5. Performance: Websites built with HTML and CSS tend to have better performance as compared to those built with heavy frameworks or content management systems (CMS). This is because the code is lightweight, resulting in faster loading times.
6. SEO Friendliness: HTML and CSS allow you to structure your web pages in a way that search engines can easily understand and index. This contributes to better search engine optimization (SEO) and improved visibility in search results.

-> Negatives of a Web Design Agency Project made with HTML and CSS:
1. Complexity: While HTML and CSS are relatively easy to learn, complex designs and advanced functionalities may require additional knowledge and expertise. Building more intricate features may require JavaScript or other programming languages.
2. Time-consuming: Creating a web design agency project solely with HTML and CSS can be time-consuming, especially for complex websites. Designing and coding each element from scratch can take more time than using pre-built templates or CMS platforms.
3. Maintenance: Websites built purely with HTML and CSS may require manual updates and maintenance. Making changes to the design or structure of the site can be labor-intensive, especially as the website scales and evolves over time.


-> It's important to note that HTML and CSS are the foundational technologies for web design, but depending on the requirements of your project, you may need to incorporate other technologies and programming languages to achieve specific functionalities or dynamic features.
